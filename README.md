# HybridShockWaveSim
This repository implements a hybrid computational framework for simulating shock waves in non-ideal gases. It integrates extended Rankine–Hugoniot models (using Peng–Robinson and Redlich–Kwong EOS), high-fidelity FVM/FDM simulations with adaptive mesh refinement, and machine learning for rapid predictions. Case studies include Real Gases
